# phase-unwrapping
This directory contains a conglomerate of some of the research work I've done at Dartmouth involving interferometry, notably the process of of phase_unwrapping. Much has been done in collaboration with graduate student Jonathon Lindbloom, who was my research partner for two terms. For detailed results of our findings, see the documents here.
There is also work here with done alongside Ian Gil, which was all done in MATLAB. The finding can also be found here, though issues with the real data collected make them a bit in conclusive. Due to the size of the dataset we used, specifically the GOTCHA Volumetric SAR Data Set provided by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), it could not be uploaded here.
