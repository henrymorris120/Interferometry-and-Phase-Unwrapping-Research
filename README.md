# phase-unwrapping
This directory contains a conglomerate of some of the research work I've done at Dartmouth involving interferometry, notably the process of of phase_unwrapping. Much has been done in collaboration with graduate student Jonathon Lindbloom, who was my research partner for two terms. For detailed results of our findings, see the documents here.
